# csv2md-wiggum

**Mission:** csv2md, a small Python command-line tool that converts a CSV file into a GitHub-flavoured Markdown table. Standard library only (argparse, csv). Tests with pytest.

## Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Create the package skeleton - csv2md/__init__.py, csv2md/cli.py with an argparse entry point runnable as python -m csv2md, a tests/ folder, requirements.txt listing pytest, and a GitHub Actions workflow at .github/workflows/test.yml that runs pytest
- [x] Task 2: Implement the core conversion - a function convert(rows) in csv2md/core.py that turns a list of CSV rows into a Markdown table with a header row and a separator row, and wire the CLI to read a CSV file path argument and print the table, with pytest tests
- [ ] Task 3: Add reading from stdin when no file path is given or the path is a single dash, with pytest tests
- [ ] Task 4: Add an --align option accepting left, right or center that changes the separator row to the matching Markdown alignment syntax, with pytest tests for all three values
- [ ] Task 5: Escape pipe characters and replace newlines inside cells with br tags so the table never breaks, and pad short rows to the header width, with pytest tests
- [ ] Task 6: Add a --no-header option that treats the first CSV row as data and emits an empty header row, with pytest tests
- [ ] Task 7: Handle errors cleanly - a missing file, an empty input and a malformed CSV must each print a one-line message to stderr and exit with status 1 and no traceback, with pytest tests
- [ ] Task 8: Write README.md with installation, usage examples for every option, and a sample input and output
